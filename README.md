pdebc - Parallel Differential Evolution Bezier Curve
=====

This project implements a parallel solution for the problem of curve fitting.
This project solves the problem of aproximation curve fitting using the Differential Evolution algorithm.


Note: Sorry about the hard to read code, it's the result of many optimizations done with the help of Callgrind.
