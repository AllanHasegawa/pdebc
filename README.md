pdebc
=====

pdebc implements a parallel version of the algorithm Differential Evolution. It tries to be as generic as possible to work with different data types.

In the "samples" I placed two implementations. "Point Fitting" and "Bezier Fitting".
-> The Point Fitting should be used as a starting framework. It shows a very basic working code.
-> The Bezier Fitting is a more complex sample, demonstrating the parallel implementation, and a python interface. Included in the sample is an ipython3 notebook containing a bezier curve fitting using matplotlib and pdebc.

I'll add more info here (maybe a proper documentation) if anyone is interested...
